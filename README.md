# termux-scripts
Collection of personal scripts I use termux to run on my phone.

Right now I only have two scripts:
#1. Setbg
This chooses a random wallpaper from a directory
#2. Rmbg
With this you can delete the random chosen wallpaper set through setbg and then it updates the wallpaper to a new one.
